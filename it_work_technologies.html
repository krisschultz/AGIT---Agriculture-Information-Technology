                            We interviewed David Taylor, an IT Manager who works for Visium Networks, a safety &
                            security company. The interview was conducted online in Microsoft Teams by two of our team
                            members on the 2nd of October 2019.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: What exactly do you do?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            David Taylor: This is a very good question. I guess I’m an IT manager at a security company,
                            dealing in security alarms and camera systems. What I largely do is manage a whole lot of
                            office server infrastructure and maintain a network with our business and equipment on it,
                            wherever the equipment is.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Please tell us about the industry that you work in.
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: The security industry tends to be quite backwards regarding technology, though where we
                            are, we are running network security systems which is starting to be common process. As
                            recent as a few years ago they were still using dial up technology. These days there is a
                            lot more IP networking.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: What other kinds of work do you do?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: Apart from what we have discussed, there is a lot of troubleshooting in my role. I don’t
                            have strict discipline job roles, so often I’ll be doing troubleshooting here and there and
                            things that you wouldn’t typically associate with an IT manager, even looking into things
                            such as why a customer can’t log into a website remotely. Customer systems have their own
                            database and users, and while we try to simplify that it can often get quite convoluted, for
                            example off-site backups and copies around the place in-case of disaster.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about
                            them.
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: Well, at the top there is the directors of the company that I answer to, largely that’s
                            about trying to get money for new stuff and the pet projects of theirs. Particularly if
                            you’re in charge and you have a technology project idea, usually you tend to run with it.
                            Some of these ideas are not practical all the time. This includes if there’s a new
                            technology that they want to integrate into the systems. For example, there are a lot of
                            fads at the moment around image processing, hardware that can identify different things in
                            images. However, integrating it and making it work is a different thing. Then of course
                            there is our service manager who does all the actual physical work to make the systems work
                            across site and making sure everything connects up. Who else is there? I suppose the sales
                            team as well, but mostly just for desktop support stuff – when their email doesn’t work. We
                            also run a call centre and if anything breaks in there, it’s usually server infrastructure
                            so software might have crashed, that sort of thing. Managing their software is ongoing. That
                            is probably the same everyone, isn’t it? We have a software developer as well who is largely
                            autonomous but we work together to get different servers and whatever else these projects
                            need to get up and running, ‘spec'ing’ things out, software developers typically don’t have
                            much of an idea when it comes to the physical hardware side of things and the requirements
                            for software that they’ve made.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: Largely, I have limited interactions. But mostly around the networking side of things,
                            so for example if there is a fault with a particular customers network, often our customers
                            are quite large corporates, so they’ll have their own IT departments, getting a fault logged
                            with them and going through their servers to get it processed, escalating problems past
                            their level one and two or to wherever it needs to be to get resolved. The reality is though
                            that once you’ve done that more than once or twice you tend to remember the names and
                            numbers of the people that you need to. It can become informal after that but that usually
                            how it works.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: What about your interactions with clients or investors?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: I don’t actually have a lot of direct interactions with clients in that sense.
                            Occasionally there might be something particularly bad that has happened to one of our
                            customer end users, something might not be working as they would have expected, or something
                            weird happened. But it would have to be unusual enough to end up on my plate. That’s pretty
                            rare actually, more just being helpful to customer support, IT departments are pretty
                            forgiving.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about those.
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: There’s the maintenance and routine type stuff. I spend all of Monday going through
                            checking things to make sure everything is right. I do this based off experience, make sure
                            there’s no beeping or lights flashing, log into everything and check them all and you’d be
                            surprised by how many problems you pick up by doing that sort of thing and from there make
                            sure all the back-ups are done. That’s a Monday then Tuesday my routine might be picking up
                            on the latest security technology updates or software that we are using which can take hours
                            to actually digest and, in the meantime, you have other bits and pieces to do. But yeah, I
                            would say it’s the routine things that take up most of my time, believe it or not. Whether
                            it is backing up a generator or what not or just making sure stuff runs smoothly. Making
                            sure nothing breaks, because in a bad situation I don’t have luxury of going home and
                            dealing with it tomorrow, I have to sit there and make sure that it is fixed. I’ve had
                            situations where that has taken 8 hours – I don’t want that to happen. And since I’ve
                            started doing this, I don’t get very many problems or things breaking in the middle of the
                            night, I haven’t had one for months.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Which aspects of your work do you find the most challenging?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: I think the most challenging part is keeping everything up to date. It cost money to buy
                            new software and equipment and it can be really hard sell to your boss. If I want $10K for
                            new software but there is no real tangible benefit other than they are up to date and won’t
                            be obsolete, and its important with cyber security, things are not getting patched and will
                            eventually break and stop working. That a very big problem, trying to make people who don’t
                            understand they actually need this.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of
                            the IT industry?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: It’s such a weird question! The essence of the IT industry as far as interacting with
                            other companies is largely around support and issue finding and troubleshooting stuff – for
                            me anyway. When you ring through to somebody from another company and you get referred, and
                            you are sitting there on the phone, working through a tough problem, that what I would call
                            the IT industry working at its best. Because you sitting their diagnosing things, fixing
                            things together, even though you don’t know who they are and this kind of rhythm to it, that
                            is universal and it just works – I'd say it’s probably that!

                            world as so
                            much of our
                            daily lives and information are likely stored online on servers. Cloud technology can be
                            defined by
                            the use of
                            storing or accessing data and services through a network most commonly, the internet. Some
                            of the
                            most common cloud
                            services are known as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and
                            infrastructure
                            as a service
                            (IaaS).

                            SaaS is a subscription based model which offers hosted software such as Microsoft office
                            365.
                            (Office.com, 2019)
                            PaaS is a subscription based model which offers hosted hardware and software solutions such
                            as
                            Microsoft azure. (Azure.microsoft.com, 2019)
                            IaaS is a subscription based model which offers hosted infrastructure such as Rackspace.
                            (Rackspace,
                            2019)

                            Each of these different services are similar in the ways they work and are all accessed via
                            the same
                            means through an internet connection from whatever device you are using or wherever you are
                            as long
                            as you have an internet connection. As the internet gets progressively faster more and more
                            users
                            are switching to cloud based services as the accessibility and availability is better than
                            ever
                            before.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the benefits to switching to cloud based services for a large company may mean
                            instead of
                            hosting rooms full of expensive server equipment running everything from software to storage
                            on
                            site, they can lease the hardware from a provider at a monthly cost varied on the companies
                            needs.
                            As the company grows and the requirements grow they can simply ask for more servers or
                            storage space
                            for example and the impact is minimal along with the cost. If the company had to expand
                            onsite
                            storage for example this could cost tens of thousands of dollars in new hardware as opposed
                            to
                            simply adding onto an existing subscription cost.

                            Cloud technology and what makes it state of the art to say is that it is forming a
                            foundation for
                            the next generation of innovation and opens up the pathway for future exciting developments.
                            The
                            technology is changing the way business is structured and operated leaving developers with a
                            platform that can be built on for many years to come.

                            Cloud computing has become extremely powerful recently and a there is now a cloud hosted
                            gaming
                            platform which offers ultra high spec gaming systems with custom servers. This allows gamers
                            to own
                            a budget pc, connect to this service and have access to some of the most powerful gaming
                            hardware
                            with a low monthly cost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means that the user is able to play a selection of the most popular gaming titles
                            available at
                            some of the highest settings and framerates without the need to pay out thousands of dollars
                            every
                            couple of years to stay up to date.

                            The future of cloud technology will build around speed and availability and we can look
                            forward to
                            seeing a huge increase in instant response time. This will allow new services such as
                            intelligence
                            on demand and VR environments for every day activities.

                            Cloud based services are made possible through the power of networking and the internet,
                            without
                            either of these there would be no cloud hosted services. Data centres also play a key role
                            in the
                            cloud as there needs to be a place to physically host all of these services and hardware
                            that is
                            being removed for the normal business environment.

                            What is the likely impact?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            The impact of the cloud is a huge deal which will and has changed the way that people,
                            business and
                            enterprise structure and scale. As cloud grows in popularity so do the services and
                            providers for
                            the technology which has opened up a whole new stream and use for the internet. This
                            technology is
                            allowing a whole new sector for training and to become a specialist in the field.

                            With a rapidly growing technology such as cloud we are starting to see more data centres
                            being built
                            and expanded all over the world as traditional data centre traffic is being overrun by cloud
                            services. According to networking giant Cisco, by 2021 cloud data centre traffic will
                            represent 95%
                            of total data centre traffic. (Provider, (GCI) and Papers, 2019)

                            The vast majority of individuals and business from small to enterprise that use a form of
                            computer
                            technology will in turn be affected in some way or another by cloud technology. This could
                            be from
                            so many different areas where cloud is used such as communicating to collaborating. For
                            business not
                            having the need to provide as much IT infrastructure on site. Workstations can run as
                            effective thin
                            clients lowering the cost of hardware. On an individual level storage services are commonly
                            used for
                            even the most basic things such as storing photos or notes from your phone.

                            As companies can work and rely on the availability and uptime of cloud services this lessens
                            the
                            need for onsite IT staff meaning that a medium sized company who may have had teams of staff
                            at each
                            office can scale back and potentially run a smaller IT team out of a head office. On the
                            other side
                            of the coin, cloud technology is also increasing the need for a skilled and specialised
                            workforce
                            which is in turn creating many new jobs across a number of areas from data centres through
                            to
                            developers, engineers and the list goes on.

                            Through my day to day life the cloud plays an integral part of both my work life and my
                            personal
                            life. All of my personal data from my mobile phone is backed up to a cloud service which
                            makes it
                            easy to change phones in case of damage or an upgrade as the backup can just be downloaded
                            to the
                            new device and from anywhere with an internet connection. The use of other cloud based
                            software
                            platforms such as Microsoft office 365 that I use for all kinds of work and communication
                            daily. In
                            my workplace we host our own cloud based services around the physical security industry
                            which has
                            turned a traditional set of analogue systems into a an IP and digital platform increasing
                            alarm
                            response times along with system uptime through cloud based monitoring platforms.

                            I have the ability to share data with colleagues and the freedom to work away from the
                            office in any
                            remote location and be able to service the business as If I were on site in the office
                            thanks to the
                            use of cloud hosted collaboration software. Even the simple things such as our phone system
                            that
                            traditionally used to be ran from an old degraded copper network known as our telephone
                            exchange has
                            been upgraded to cloud hosted telecommunications technology using voice over IP or VoiP for
                            short.
                            This service offers a higher call quality along with less downtime.

                            Members of my family and friends also embrace the use of these above mentioned services as
                            it makes
                            their lives easier. Many cloud services offer family options where for a slightly higher
                            plan cost
                            the whole family can make use of the particular service. For example, I can purchase a
                            subscription
                            plan to Microsoft office 365 and for a few dollars extra use the software on more than just
                            the one
                            device. In many cases when purchasing an app for the smartphone it can be downloaded to up
                            to five
                            other family members through family sharing.

                            In summary cloud, services, servers and everything that this technology encumbers is a
                            rapidly
                            growing industry that is forging a pathway for the way that we interact with computers and
                            technology in our daily lives as well as creating a platform for exciting future development
                            which
                            in my opinion is limitless.

                            What does it do?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Small computing devices, also known as SBCs (Single Board Computers), like Raspberry PIs,
                            Arduinos
                            and Makey Makeys have become more popular than ever before. But what are those devices and
                            what can
                            they actually do?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The initial idea of these little computers was to provide affordable hardware with enough
                            power to
                            students and non-students to learn programming and engineering in a practical way. This idea
                            completely took off, and nowadays they are used everywhere: by students, hobbyists, or
                            companies to
                            develop and prototype projects of all kinds. They can also be used by pupils to get in
                            contact with
                            programming for the first time and to learn about science. Universities use them for
                            instance to
                            monitor and control robots or race cars. Another common usage is IoT (Internet of Things).
                            This is a
                            network of sensors and actuators in combination with SBCs which are locally separated but
                            communicate over the internet (or a local area network). For example, if an optical sensor
                            in a
                            warehouse senses too much light, window shades, up high on the roof, could be closed
                            automatically.
                            If now, however, the temperature drops to a critical point, another device could switch on a
                            heater.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SBCs are often not bigger than a credit card. The Raspberry PI foundation, for instance, has just released the 4th version of its SBC which allows a user to connect two 4k displays, USB3 devices and Gigabit Ethernet – all of that on a circuit board which measures only 85x56mm (Raspberrypi.org, 2019). However, one of the main features of all of these devices is the “General-purpose input/output” (GPIO). The GPIOs are required to read and send data to sensors like temperature-, motion-, magnetic- and light sensors, and actuators like servo-, stepper- or DC motors, relays or solenoids. The variety of sensors and actuators are endless and in combination with these little computers, the applications are unlimited. In the end, the computer code written by the developer decides what the SBC does.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A just recently released SBC is Google’s “Coral”. Coral’s focus lies in a different area, though. It comes with a tensor processing unit (TPS) that helps to accelerate AI processing locally (Coral.withgoogle.com, 2019). Similarly, NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano, also released in 2019, is equipped with a 128 core GPU – this is also a great advantage for AI processing (NVIDIA Developer, 2019). The benefits of the local processing units are clear: the data is saved locally; it is independent from the internet and delays caused by the internet connections are reduced. Concerns about privacy are also limited as the data isn’t being processed in some random datacentres.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the first appearance of single board computers, their power has increased substantially and the use cases of them are not limited to data input / output and scrips which process that data, anymore. For instance, the “UDOO x86 Ultra” or the “LattePanda 4G/64GB” are powerful enough to run mainstream operating systems like Windows 10 (Lattepanda.com, 2019) and can run most applications an average user would use. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are likely to be two technological developments for SBCs in the near future which
                            don’t
                            necessarily require new but refined technology. The first development would be an even
                            higher
                            performance, more RAM and higher CPU & GPU speed. The other one would be the further
                            development of
                            AI technology for these devices. With that development, the application area will be even
                            broader
                            and yet in some cases (Coral or Jetson) more specific and specialized.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To conclude, SBCs are (often) low-cost single board computers which have been originally
                            developed
                            for educational purposes. They are very small and yet powerful and can be used as a day-to
                            day
                            computer orin combination with sensors and actors to realize many different hardware
                            projects or to
                            provide an edge-computing solution for CPU-core demanding applications like AI on an
                            energy-efficient base. They are likely to increase in CPU, GPU and RAM and will be even more
                            suitable for the tasks given above.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            What is the likely impact?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            These devices are quite unlimited in their options and use cases already. But how are
                            they going
                            to impact our future, what could potentially change and how could be most affected?

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AI specific SBCs like the Coral or Jetson show that there could be a potential shift from
                            cloud
                            computing to edge computing. Companies and individuals could use these devices to process
                            their AI
                            locally instead of using big companies and their datacenters for that.
                            The complete opposite, however, comes in connection with cloud computing. As some SBC
                            hardware is
                            available already to run day to day tasks, clouds could be used to outsource more
                            CPU-demanding
                            tasks. A trend could develop to move away from powerful desktop- or laptop computers and
                            replace
                            them with cheaper SBCs. One result of that would be that people save money and resources and
                            people
                            which weren’t able to afford computers before, can possibly afford one now. Another
                            advantage of
                            using SBCs instead of bigger unites would be the potential reduction of energy consumption
                            as well
                            as the reduced demand for natural resources to produce the often “overpowered” home
                            computers.
                            Furthermore, the number of developers grow bigger and bigger. This can result in a flood of
                            very
                            innovative, new products developed in cooperation with professionals and non-professionals.
                            The open
                            source project “MagicMirror” (<a
                                href="https://magicmirror.builders/">https://magicmirror.builders/</a>) is a good
                            example for
                            that.
                            However, not only open source projects will benefit from SBCs. The number of tech startups
                            will also
                            increase as the financial capital needed is much smaller than without the accessibility of
                            those
                            tiny little helpers. This is likely to result in more competition and therefore higher
                            quality
                            products and probably also in a broader spectrum of innovations.

                            How will this affect you?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            How are those SBCs going to affect me, my families or friends? What is going to change?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If they are going to be market a bit differently (more towards day-to-day user than towards
                            the avid
                            programmer or engineer), I think they can have a big impact on my friends and family. Many
                            of them
                            don’t require a lot of power and they could easily use these devices which then saves them
                            money. A
                            more subtle effect will be the appearance of smart devices which may have been develop on a
                            base of
                            SBCs and which possibly would not have been developed or only at a later point without the
                            accessibility of them.

                            I have personally only used the Raspberry PI so far, but they sparked such an interest in IT
                            in me,
                            that I have decided to dive deeper into the field and to study it. In the future, they will
                            likely
                            be used for three things by me.
                            First and for now most importantly, they will provide me a hardware base to support my
                            studies at
                            low cost. They will be my first choice to explore and learn IT hands-on. Arduinos or
                            Raspberry PIs
                            for more general programming experiences and to gain IoT knowledge, hardware like Coral or
                            Jetson as
                            a platform for potential AI studies.
