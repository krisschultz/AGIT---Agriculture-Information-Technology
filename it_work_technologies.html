                            Clouds, services and servers play a large and growing role in the information technology
                            world as so
                            much of our
                            daily lives and information are likely stored online on servers. Cloud technology can be
                            defined by
                            the use of
                            storing or accessing data and services through a network most commonly, the internet. Some
                            of the
                            most common cloud
                            services are known as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and
                            infrastructure
                            as a service
                            (IaaS).

                            SaaS is a subscription based model which offers hosted software such as Microsoft office
                            365.
                            (Office.com, 2019)
                            PaaS is a subscription based model which offers hosted hardware and software solutions such
                            as
                            Microsoft azure. (Azure.microsoft.com, 2019)
                            IaaS is a subscription based model which offers hosted infrastructure such as Rackspace.
                            (Rackspace,

                            Each of these different services are similar in the ways they work and are all accessed via
                            the same
                            means through an internet connection from whatever device you are using or wherever you are
                            as long
                            as you have an internet connection. As the internet gets progressively faster more and more
                            users
                            are switching to cloud based services as the accessibility and availability is better than
                            ever
                            before.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the benefits to switching to cloud based services for a large company may mean
                            instead of
                            hosting rooms full of expensive server equipment running everything from software to storage
                            on
                            site, they can lease the hardware from a provider at a monthly cost varied on the companies
                            needs.
                            As the company grows and the requirements grow they can simply ask for more servers or
                            storage space
                            for example and the impact is minimal along with the cost. If the company had to expand
                            onsite
                            storage for example this could cost tens of thousands of dollars in new hardware as opposed
                            to
                            simply adding onto an existing subscription cost.

                            Cloud technology and what makes it state of the art to say is that it is forming a
                            foundation for
                            the next generation of innovation and opens up the pathway for future exciting developments.
                            The
                            technology is changing the way business is structured and operated leaving developers with a
                            platform that can be built on for many years to come.

                            The future of cloud technology will build around speed and availability and we can look
                            forward to
                            seeing a huge increase in instant response time. This will allow new services such as

                            Cloud based services are made possible through the power of networking and the internet,
                            without
                            either of these there would be no cloud hosted services. Data centres also play a key role
                            in the
                            cloud as there needs to be a place to physically host all of these services and hardware
                            that is
                            being removed for the normal business environment.

                        <p>
                            The impact of the cloud is a huge deal which will and has changed the way that people,
                            business and

                            the technology which has opened up a whole new stream and use for the internet. This
                            technology is
                            allowing a whole new sector for training and to become a specialist in the field.

                            With a rapidly growing technology such as cloud we are starting to see more data centres
                            being built
                            and expanded all over the world as traditional data centre traffic is being overrun by cloud
                            services. According to networking giant Cisco, by 2021 cloud data centre traffic will
                            represent 95%
                            of total data centre traffic. (Provider, (GCI) and Papers, 2019)

                            The vast majority of individuals and business from small to enterprise that use a form of
                            computer
                            technology will in turn be affected in some way or another by cloud technology. This could
                            be from
                            so many different areas where cloud is used such as communicating to collaborating. For

                            having the need to provide as much IT infrastructure on site. Workstations can run as
                            effective thin
                            clients lowering the cost of hardware. On an individual level storage services are commonly
                            used for
                            even the most basic things such as storing photos or notes from your phone.

                            As companies can work and rely on the availability and uptime of cloud services this lessens
                            the
                            need for onsite IT staff meaning that a medium sized company who may have had teams of staff
                            at each

                            other side
                            of the coin, cloud technology is also increasing the need for a skilled and specialised
                            workforce
                            which is in turn creating many new jobs across a number of areas from data centres through
                            to
                            developers, engineers and the list goes on.

                            Through my day to day life the cloud plays an integral part of both my work life and my
                            personal
                            life. All of my personal data from my mobile phone is backed up to a cloud service which
                            makes it
                            easy to change phones in case of damage or an upgrade as the backup can just be downloaded
                            to the
                            new device and from anywhere with an internet connection. The use of other cloud based
                            software
                            platforms such as Microsoft office 365 that I use for all kinds of work and communication
                            daily. In
                            my workplace we host our own cloud based services around the physical security industry
                            which has
                            turned a traditional set of analogue systems into a an IP and digital platform increasing
                            alarm
                            response times along with system uptime through cloud based monitoring platforms.

                            I have the ability to share data with colleagues and the freedom to work away from the
                            office in any
                            remote location and be able to service the business as If I were on site in the office
                            thanks to the
                            use of cloud hosted collaboration software. Even the simple things such as our phone system
                            that
                            traditionally used to be ran from an old degraded copper network known as our telephone

                            been upgraded to cloud hosted telecommunications technology using voice over IP or VoiP for
                            short.
                            This service offers a higher call quality along with less downtime.

                            Members of my family and friends also embrace the use of these above mentioned services as
                            it makes
                            their lives easier. Many cloud services offer family options where for a slightly higher
                            plan cost
                            the whole family can make use of the particular service. For example, I can purchase a
                            subscription
                            plan to Microsoft office 365 and for a few dollars extra use the software on more than just
                            the one
                            device. In many cases when purchasing an app for the smartphone it can be downloaded to up
                            to five
                            other family members through family sharing.

                            In summary cloud, services, servers and everything that this technology encumbers is a
                            rapidly
                            growing industry that is forging a pathway for the way that we interact with computers and
                            technology in our daily lives as well as creating a platform for exciting future development
                            which
                            in my opinion is limitless.

                        <p>
                            Small computing devices, also known as SBCs (Single Board Computers), like Raspberry PIs,
                            Arduinos
                            and Makey Makeys have become more popular than ever before. But what are those devices and
                            what can
                            they actually do?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The initial idea of these little computers was to provide affordable hardware with enough
                            power to
                            students and non-students to learn programming and engineering in a practical way. This idea
                            completely took off, and nowadays they are used everywhere: by students, hobbyists, or
                            companies to
                            develop and prototype projects of all kinds. They can also be used by pupils to get in
                            contact with
                            programming for the first time and to learn about science. Universities use them for
                            instance to
                            monitor and control robots or race cars. Another common usage is IoT (Internet of Things).
                            This is a
                            network of sensors and actuators in combination with SBCs which are locally separated but
                            communicate over the internet (or a local area network). For example, if an optical sensor
                            in a
                            warehouse senses too much light, window shades, up high on the roof, could be closed
                            automatically.
                            If now, however, the temperature drops to a critical point, another device could switch on a
                            heater.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SBCs are often not bigger than a credit card. The Raspberry PI foundation, for instance, has
                            just
                            released the 4th version of its SBC which allows a user to connect two 4k displays, USB3
                            devices and
                            Gigabit Ethernet – all of that on a circuit board which measures only 85x56mm. However, one
                            of the
                            main features of all of these devices is the “General-purpose input/output” (GPIO). The
                            GPIOs are
                            required to read and send data to sensors like temperature-, motion-, magnetic- and light
                            sensors,
                            and actuators like servo-, stepper- or DC motors, relays or solenoids. The variety of
                            sensors and
                            actuators are endless and in combination with these little computers, the applications are
                            unlimited. In the end, the computer code written by the developer decides what the SBC does.

                            A just recently released SBC is Google’s “Coral”. Coral’s focus lies in a different area,
                            though. It
                            comes with a tensor processing unit (TPS) that helps to accelerate AI processing locally.
                            Similarly,
                            NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano, also released in 2019, is equipped with a 128 core GPU – this is also
                            a great
                            advantage for AI processing. The benefits of the local processing units are clear: the data
                            is saved
                            locally; it is independent from the internet and delays caused by the internet connections
                            are
                            reduced. Concerns about privacy are also limited as the data isn’t being processed in some
                            random
                            datacenters.

                            Since the first appearance of single board computers, their power has increased
                            substantially and
                            the use cases of them are not limited to data input / output and scrips which process that
                            data,
                            anymore. For instance, the “UDOO x86 Ultra” or the “LattePanda 4G/64GB” are powerful enough
                            to run
                            mainstream operating systems like Windows 10 and can run most applications an average user
                            would
                            use.

                            There are likely to be two technological developments for SBCs in the near future which
                            don’t
                            necessarily require new but refined technology. The first development would be an even
                            higher
                            performance, more RAM and higher CPU & GPU speed. The other one would be the further
                            development of
                            AI technology for these devices. With that development, the application area will be even
                            broader
                            and yet in some cases (Coral or Jetson) more specific and specialized.

                        <p>
                            To conclude, SBCs are (often) low-cost single board computers which have been originally
                            developed
                            for educational purposes. They are very small and yet powerful and can be used as a day-to
                            day
                            computer orin combination with sensors and actors to realize many different hardware
                            projects or to
                            provide an edge-computing solution for CPU-core demanding applications like AI on an
                            energy-efficient base. They are likely to increase in CPU, GPU and RAM and will be even more
                            suitable for the tasks given above.

                            What is the likely impact?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            These devices are quite unlimited in their options and use cases already. But how are
                            they going
                            to impact our future, what could potentially change and how could be most affected?

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AI specific SBCs like the Coral or Jetson show that there could be a potential shift from
                            cloud
                            computing to edge computing. Companies and individuals could use these devices to process
                            their AI
                            locally instead of using big companies and their datacenters for that.
                            The complete opposite, however, comes in connection with cloud computing. As some SBC
                            hardware is
                            available already to run day to day tasks, clouds could be used to outsource more
                            CPU-demanding
                            tasks. A trend could develop to move away from powerful desktop- or laptop computers and
                            replace
                            them with cheaper SBCs. One result of that would be that people save money and resources and
                            people
                            which weren’t able to afford computers before, can possibly afford one now. Another
                            advantage of
                            using SBCs instead of bigger unites would be the potential reduction of energy consumption
                            as well
                            as the reduced demand for natural resources to produce the often “overpowered” home
                            computers.
                            Furthermore, the number of developers grow bigger and bigger. This can result in a flood of
                            very
                            innovative, new products developed in cooperation with professionals and non-professionals.
                            The open
                            source project “MagicMirror” (<a
                                href="https://magicmirror.builders/">https://magicmirror.builders/</a>) is a good
                            example for
                            that.
                            However, not only open source projects will benefit from SBCs. The number of tech startups
                            will also
                            increase as the financial capital needed is much smaller than without the accessibility of
                            those
                            tiny little helpers. This is likely to result in more competition and therefore higher
                            quality
                            products and probably also in a broader spectrum of innovations.

                            If they are going to be market a bit differently (more towards day-to-day user than towards
                            the avid
                            programmer or engineer), I think they can have a big impact on my friends and family. Many
                            of them
                            don’t require a lot of power and they could easily use these devices which then saves them
                            money. A
                            more subtle effect will be the appearance of smart devices which may have been develop on a
                            base of
                            SBCs and which possibly would not have been developed or only at a later point without the
                            accessibility of them.

                            I have personally only used the Raspberry PI so far, but they sparked such an interest in IT
                            in me,
                            that I have decided to dive deeper into the field and to study it. In the future, they will
                            likely
                            be used for three things by me.
                            First and for now most importantly, they will provide me a hardware base to support my
                            studies at
                            low cost. They will be my first choice to explore and learn IT hands-on. Arduinos or
                            Raspberry PIs
                            for more general programming experiences and to gain IoT knowledge, hardware like Coral or
                            Jetson as
                            a platform for potential AI studies.
