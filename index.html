                The results of these 3 tests remind me to be aware of my personal strengths and weaknesses to improve upon my decision-making and communication skills. These tests have revealed a range of characteristics that accentuate my personality and style of learning. With better understanding of myself, I am able to actively make decisions that will produce optimal results based on my characteristics. For example, I may consciously pace myself regarding my studies in relation to the fact that individuals of my personality type often struggle during stressful encounters (NERIS Analytics Limited 2019). Additionally, I have begun restructuring my style of learning to be more visual. Practical applications of this include illustrating new information as mind maps and spider diagrams.

                  The results of these tests will help me to infuence my behaviour in a team positvely. Being aware of my strong and not so strong points should enable me to consider those in communication, planning and execution. It should also help me to find my position in a team as well as control my sensitivity, self-esteem, idealism and support me in decision making processes. To use my strongest points in a team efficiently, I should find a leading / planning role in a team. Members of the team should complement my skillset (be strong in decision making processes, good in communication and willing to finish their part of the project). To learn personally and therefore improve the outcome of projects, the members should be able to communicate verbaly. Roles and workload should be clearly distributed to avoid me taking on other people's work.

Test results have shown that I will work well as both a participant in a team along with taking on a managing role within the team environment. When forming a team I will be looking to make contact with other students by taking a proactive approach and reaching out to other people that have skillsets which would work well together.

                                            My name is Nathan Bresser my student ID is s3819728 and I’m a member of
                                            group AGIT. I am a 24 year-old Canberra native currently living in Sydney
                                            and working for a big four consulting firm and my hobbies are cycling and
                                            watching films. My grandparents emigrated from the Netherlands in the 60s
                                            and I am an English speaker. I’ve had an interest in IT from a very young
                                            age when my farther taught me how to use the family PC. Since then I lost
                                            touch with IT and pursued a career in accounting but have found that as time
                                            goes on, I continue to seek out opportunities at work that allow me to learn
                                            and develop my IT skills. My curiosity with IT was sparked again when I
                                            realised I could automate some of my work with VBA in Excel and currently my
                                            interest is focused on developing a ASP.NET web application. Through this
                                            project at work I've been able to explore HTML with Bootstrap, C# and SQL.
                                            This has exposed to me that If I want to pursue IT properly as a career, I
                                            need a formal education in the fundamentals, so I have decided to enrol in
                                            the Bachelor of IT at RMIT. My goal is to move from my Finance focused
                                            career path to a role where I can leverage my finance experience, business
                                            acumen and my IT skills.

                                            and for
                                            special events. I started out without prior experience or knowledge but
                                            gained
                                            many new
                                            skills and broadened my range of understanding. I regularly assist by
                                            maintaining the audio
                                            and visual equipment such as projectors, microphones, mixers, cables,
                                            amongst
                                            other
                                            hardware. My interest in Information Technology (IT) stems from the amazing
                                            innovation
                                            behind the development of technology by large companies and small projects
                                            created by a
                                            single person. From my perspective, technology is not limited by the
                                            capabilities of
                                            hardware, but rather by the creativity of the idea. Although I have had no
                                            professional
                                            experience in the world of IT, I have always immersed myself in discovering
                                            ways
                                            of making
                                            my entertainment more convenient or accessible.

                                            Hi, I’m Kris and I am from the SE suburbs of Melbourne VIC with English as
                                            my
                                            only spoken
                                            language. Student number S3819605 and our team name is AGIT. In 2000 I
                                            finished
                                            my VCE along
                                            with a few TAFE certifications in IT, since then I have studied off and on
                                            with
                                            some vendor
                                            specific certs such as CompTIA Network+ which I achieved in 2012 and have
                                            also
                                            trained
                                            online with CBTNuggets for the cisco CCNA, Microsoft server and exchange
                                            server
                                            but did not
                                            complete the certification track due to workload.. I have always had an
                                            interest
                                            in IT since
                                            around the age of 8 which was sparked by my first computer, the commodore
                                            amiga
                                            64. Since
                                            then I had grown up with having computers and laptops which at the time in
                                            the
                                            80’s and 90’s
                                            was not such a common thing unlike today. At the age of 12 I started to work
                                            on
                                            computer
                                            hardware which lead to starting my first business at 16 as a pc builder.
                                            Once I
                                            finished
                                            school I moved away from the IT world to work in the trades to which I
                                            eventually started
                                            working for a physical security company (CCTV, alarm, access control) which
                                            was
                                            heavily IP
                                            based and re sparked my interest in working with IT.

                                            My name is Kristian Muller my student ID is s3728068 and I'm group member of
                                            AGIT. I
                                            currently reside in the beach suburb of Henley Beach South Australia. I'm
                                            currently studying
                                            a bachelor of logistics and supply chain management at RMIT. My hobbies
                                            include
                                            playing
                                            footy and golf on the weekend as well as watching a good movie. My interest
                                            in
                                            IT is
                                            functional; it is in a variety of software and hardware that can make the
                                            supply
                                            chain
                                            increasingly efficient for businesses to manage. I have always had an
                                            interest
                                            in IT, but
                                            recently this has developed into a specific interest in software that
                                            contributes to supply
                                            chain management effectiveness for firms like WIMS, WMS or JAIX. This new
                                            interest has come
                                            about since the warehouse I work in part time has moved from using
                                            paper-based
                                            inventory
                                            control to paperless RF scanners. I haven’t had much experience in IT apart
                                            from
                                            using the
                                            basics in the Microsoft suite and beginning to use RF scanners at work to
                                            control inventory.
                                            However, I am interested in broadening my knowledge in the area.

                                                My name is Benjamin Brooks (s3786942, <a href="mailto:s3786942@student.rmit.edu.au">s3786942@student.rmit.edu.au</a>), I was born in Sydney, Australia and currently live in Balmain East and I’m part of the group AGIT. My parents are multigenerational Australians with English, Irish and Italian ancestry. I completed my high school education in 2009, since then I have completed a Diploma of Financial Planning and am working towards a Bachelor of Business. I speak English but would love to learn another language at some point in the future (maybe a programming language). My interests include exercise, sports, philosophy, meditation and travel. My interest in IT is based on my current lack of technological knowledge. I want to be able to participate effectively and make use of advancing technologies. I am a Wealth Consultant at Westpac and use role specific programs, I can use basic programs like Word, Power Point etc. and use a number of social media platforms. I chose to study at RMIT as I want to pursue a career in finance, in particular financial analysis. Having a strong understanding of Information Technology will be very useful, as using data and presenting data will be a key function in finance.

                                            My name is Angelo Kock, my student number is s3819893 and I am a member of
                                            the
                                            group AGIT. I
                                            have been in Australia for nearly three years and have just been granted my
                                            permanent
                                            residency. Originally, I am from Germany so logically my first language is
                                            German. I grew up
                                            in Hamburg, a city with a
                                            population of just over 2 mio. people. My lifestyle in Australia has changed
                                            drastically, as
                                            I live and work in a rural area on a cattle farm. I enjoy both, technology
                                            and
                                            nature and I
                                            would like to bring both of
                                            these areas together and utilise IT to improve farming practices, reduce
                                            excessive use and
                                            wastage of natural
                                            resources and consequently reduce the cost of operation in farming. My
                                            interests
                                            in IT
                                            started when I was young. I
                                            used thefirst video game consoles and desktop computers and eventually, with
                                            the
                                            vast
                                            development of
                                            IT within the last 15 years (introduction of the iPhone, HighSpeed Internet,
                                            Cloud
                                            Computing, automatization, IoT & MachineLearning),
                                            I realized that IT can be used for so much more. It can be used not only for
                                            big
                                            companies
                                            to do, for
                                            instance, complex calculations, but it can now actually be used to make
                                            everyone’s
                                            day-to-day tasks easier. As soon as I had realized that, I started to get
                                            more
                                            interested in
                                            programming and
                                            IoT. I also started to learn a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as
                                            well as
                                            Python and
                                            developed my own little projects with the Raspberry Pi. My studies at the
                                            RMIT
                                            will
                                            hopefully guide me the way to become a professional in IT and will help me
                                            to
                                            develop
                                            solutions for a more sustainable world, supported by IT.

                                            I also completed an only psychometric text for abstract reasoning. This
                                            required me to find the missing item in sequences and matrixes of shapes and
                                            symbols. This was the first time I have attempted a test like this and I was
                                            only able to get to 4 of the 15 questions in the seven minutes and thirty
                                            seconds of time provided. I was able to answer 3 of the questions correctly.
